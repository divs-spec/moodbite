# moodbite

MoodBite is a personalized meal planning app that recommends real, fully cooked dishes based on your mood, dietary needs, calorie goals, cuisine preferences, and meal time — without falling into the boring “just eat a salad” trap.

No guesswork. No fusion confusion. Just proper food, properly timed.

## ✨ Why MoodBite?

Most meal apps ignore when you eat and how you feel.
MoodBite fixes that.

✅ Mood-aware recommendations

✅ Strict meal-time logic

✅ Real cooked meals (curries, bowls, pastas, grills)

✅ Cuisine purity (no random fusion)

✅ Elevenses & Brunch finally taken seriously

## 🧠 How It Works
### 1️⃣ Choose Your Meal Time (Mandatory First Step)

You must select exactly one category:

🥣 Breakfast

☕ Elevenses

🍳 Brunch

🍛 Lunch

🍪 Snack

🍽️ Dinner

Meals are generated only for the selected category — no crossovers, no repeats.

### 2️⃣ Tell Us About You

MoodBite then considers:
- Your current mood (tired, stressed, energetic, comfort-seeking, etc.)
- Dietary preferences (veg, vegan, non-veg, gluten-free, etc.)
- Calorie target
- Cuisine selection (multi-select supported)

### 3️⃣ Get Smart Meal Suggestions

You’ll receive 3–5 fully cooked meal options, each with:

- Dish name
- Cuisine
- Estimated calories
- Why it fits your mood + meal time
- Optional sides (salads allowed only as extras)

## 🕒 Meal-Time Intelligence (Hard Rules)

| Meal Time     | Rules                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Breakfast** | Light, energizing, easy to digest |
| **Elevenses** | Small portions, low calorie       |
| **Brunch**    | Hybrid of breakfast + lunch       |
| **Lunch**     | Balanced, filling cooked meals    |
| **Snack**     | Small but satisfying              |
| **Dinner**    | Heavier, indulgent, distinct      |

🚫 No repeating dishes across categories

🚫 No raw-only meals

🚫 No salad-as-main bias
